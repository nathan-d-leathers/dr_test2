To Start this Project:

- Open Two Terminals
- cd one into the Backend folder and one in the Frontend folder

In the Backend Terminal:

- make sure a venv has been created and activated (if you store venvs in a seperate folder, cd into that folder to start venv and than return to Backend project folder)
- to create new venv in the command line enter 
  $ python3 -m venv "venv_name"
- to activate your new venv in the command line enter 
  $ source "venv_name"/bin/activate


- make sure to install all project requirements in the command line by entering 
  $ pip install -r requirements.txt
- start postgres with brew services start postgres

- create a local database in the command line by entering 
  $ createdb dr_db

if confronted with migrations errors (there should be no migrations required):
- in dr_app views.py comment out Line 5 (import dotenv) and Line 9 (import googlemaps)
- from the command line make model migrations by entering 
  $ python manage.py makemigrations dr_app 
  $ python manage.py migrate


In the Frontend Terminal:

-due to certain out of date dependices run the following command to install necessacry dependices:
  $ npm install --force 
  alt
  $ npm install legacy--peer-deps
  
  *there will be an aduit message as well as warnings for vunrelibilties* 
  as this was a school project there was not adequate time to find new packages to repair the app, I am leaving the legacy version up as a functional but noted learning expirence

- to start frontend enivroment from the command line enter
  $ npm run watch
  
  
-Switch to Front End Terminal-
 
 -in the frontend folder enter in the command line
  $ python manage.py runserver
  

-Open your internet browser-

 enter localhost:8000 in the address bar
  
At this point the project should be live. Create an account and play aroudn with the enviroment.


*Tip: Leave two terminals running in the backgroudn and open a third terminal to interact with the database and git
